## Understanding Compensation

Before you start calculating payroll, it's important to understand how staff get paid.

### 1. Compensation Profiles (Pay Structures)

Each staff member chooses one of these options:

| Profile Name | Hourly Rate | Commission Rate | Best For |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **High Base, Low Commission** | $25/hour | 5% | New staff, prefer stability |
| **Balanced** *(Default)* | $18/hour | 15% | Most staff, good mix |
| **Commission Heavy** | $12/hour | 30% | Experienced, high performers |
| **Pure Commission** | $0/hour | 50% | Top performers, self-motivated |

**Example:**
- Sarah chooses "Balanced" ($18/hr + 15% commission)
- She works 40 hours and earns $4,000 in service revenue
- Her pay = ($18 × 40) + ($4,000 × 15%) = $720 + $600 = **$1,320**

### 2. Performance Tiers

Each month, staff are automatically placed in a tier based on completed appointments:

| Tier | Appointments | Commission Boost | Monthly Bonus |
|------|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| 🥉 **Bronze** | 0-20 | Normal (1x) | $0 |
| 🥈 **Silver** | 21-40 | +20% (1.2x) | $100 |
| 🥇 **Gold** | 41-60 | +50% (1.5x) | $300 |
| 💎 **Platinum** | 61+ | Double (2x) | $500 |

**Example:**
- Sarah completes 45 appointments → She's in **Gold Tier**
- Her commission gets boosted by 50%
- Base commission: $600 → Gold commission: $600 × 1.5 = **$900**
- Plus she gets a **$300 bonus** for reaching Gold!

### 3. Bonus Types

You can give bonuses for many reasons:

- 🎁 **Custom**: Any reason (e.g., "Great job this month!")
- 🎉 **Milestone**: 100th appointment, 1-year anniversary
- 🎄 **Holiday**: Working on Christmas, Valentine's Day
- ⭐ **Quality**: 10 consecutive 5-star reviews
- ⚡ **Speed**: Completing appointments faster
- 👥 **Referral**: Bringing in new customers or staff
- 🔄 **Retention**: Repeat customers (automatic)

**Example Bonuses:**
- Sarah worked Christmas week → Give her $150 holiday bonus
- Mike completed 100 appointments → Give him $200 milestone bonus

### 4. How Hours are Calculated

**Important**: You don't need to track attendance!

The system automatically estimates hours based on:
- ✅ Service durations (e.g., haircut = 30 min, color = 90 min)
- ✅ Buffer time (15 minutes per appointment for setup/cleanup)

**Example:**
- Sarah did 10 appointments:
  - 5 haircuts (30 min each) = 150 min
  - 3 color services (90 min each) = 270 min
  - 2 treatments (60 min each) = 120 min
- Total service time = 540 minutes
- Buffer time = 10 × 15 min = 150 min
- **Total hours** = (540 + 150) ÷ 60 = **11.5 hours**

## How to Calculate Monthly Payroll

This is what you'll do at the end of every month.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Open Payroll Management

1. Click **💰 Payroll Management** in the sidebar

2. You'll see two dropdown menus:
   - **Month**: Select the month you want to calculate (e.g., "December")
   - **Year**: Select the year (e.g., "2025")

![Period Selector]
```
Period: [December ▼] [2025 ▼]
```

**Tip**: Always calculate for the **previous month** (e.g., on January 5th, calculate for December)

#### Step 3: Calculate Payroll

1. Click the big **"🔄 Calculate Payroll"** button
2. Wait 2-3 seconds (you'll see "⏳ Calculating...")
3. The system will:
   - ✅ Count all completed appointments for each staff member
   - ✅ Calculate hours worked
   - ✅ Calculate base pay (hours × hourly rate)
   - ✅ Calculate commissions (service revenue × commission rate)
   - ✅ Apply performance tier boosts
   - ✅ Add all bonuses
   - ✅ Calculate final net pay

#### Step 4: Review the Results

After calculation completes, you'll see:

**Summary Cards** (at the top):
```
┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐
│👥 Staff  │ │💵 Net Pay│ │💎 Comm   │ │🎁 Bonus  │
│Total: 5  │ │$12,500   │ │$4,200    │ │$1,500    │
└──────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘
```

**Payroll Table** (below):
- Each row = One staff member
- Columns show: Name, Tier, **Hours**, Base Pay, Commission, Bonuses, Net Pay, Status

**What does the Hours column show?**
- The **Hours column** displays estimated working hours for the month
- Calculated automatically from appointment service durations + 15 min buffer per appointment
- Example: Sarah shows "45.5h" = 45.5 hours worked in December
- Used to calculate base pay: Hours × Hourly Rate
- **No time clock needed!** Hours are estimated from actual work done
- For detailed explanation, see: [PAYROLL_HOURS_EXPLANATION.md](PAYROLL_HOURS_EXPLANATION.md)

#### Step 5: Verify the Data

Check each staff member's payroll:
- ✅ Are the hours reasonable? (Compare to appointment count and service types)
- ✅ Is the commission correct?
- ✅ Are any bonuses missing?

**If something is wrong:**
- Add missing bonuses (see next section)
- Click "Calculate Payroll" again to recalculate

---

## How to Approve & Pay Staff

After calculating and reviewing payroll, you need to approve and mark as paid.

### Understanding Payroll Status

Each payroll record has a **status badge**:

| Status | Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Draft** | Gray | Not calculated yet |
| **Calculated** | Blue | Calculated, needs approval |
| **Approved** | Green | Approved, ready to pay |
| **Paid** | Purple | Payment completed ✅ |

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### Step 1: Review Calculated Payroll

After clicking "Calculate Payroll", all records show **"calculated"** status (blue).

#### Step 2: Approve Each Staff Member

1. In the payroll table, look at the **"Actions"** column
2. You'll see a **"✓ Approve"** button for each staff member
3. Click **"✓ Approve"** for each person
4. A confirmation dialog appears: **"Approve this payroll record?"**
5. Click **"OK"**
6. Status changes to **"approved"** (green)

**Tip**: Only approve if you've verified the amounts are correct!

#### Step 3: Process Actual Payments

Now you need to actually pay your staff using your normal method:
- Bank transfer
- Check
- Cash
- Payroll service (like ADP, Gusto, etc.)

**The payroll system doesn't send payments** - it only calculates amounts.

#### Step 4: Mark as Paid

After you've sent the actual payments:

1. Go back to the payroll table
2. For each approved record, you'll see **"💳 Mark Paid"** button
3. Click **"💳 Mark Paid"**
4. Confirmation: **"Mark this payroll as paid?"**
5. Click **"OK"**
6. Status changes to **"paid"** (purple)

### Complete Workflow Example

```
End of December:

Day 1 (Jan 1st):
- Calculate December payroll
- Review all amounts
- Add holiday bonuses

Day 2 (Jan 2nd):
- Approve all payroll records
- Process bank transfers to staff

Day 3 (Jan 3rd):
- Verify payments went through
- Mark all records as "paid"
- ✅ Done! December payroll complete
```

### What if I Made a Mistake?

**Before Approval:**
- Just recalculate the payroll (fixes automatically)

**After Approval but Before Paid:**
- Add correction bonuses (positive or negative)
- Recalculate
- Re-approve

**After Paid:**
- Make adjustment in next month's payroll
- Example: Overpaid $50 → Deduct $50 next month (add negative bonus)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No payroll data for this period"

**Cause**: Payroll hasn't been calculated yet for the selected month.

**Solution**: Click "🔄 Calculate Payroll" button.

---

### Issue: Hours showing 0 for a staff member

**Possible Causes**:
1. No completed appointments for that month
2. Appointments missing service duration data

**Solution**:
1. Check appointments table: Do they have completed appointments?
2. Check services: Do services have duration values set?
3. If services lack durations, add them in Services page

---

### Issue: Commission is $0

**Possible Causes**:
1. Staff has 0% commission rate in their profile
2. No service revenue for the month
3. All appointments are cancelled/pending

**Solution**:
1. Check staff compensation profile (should have commission_rate > 0)
2. Verify appointments status = "completed"
3. Check appointment_services table has services with prices

---

### Issue: Bonuses not showing in payroll

**Cause**: Forgot to recalculate after adding bonus.

**Solution**: Click "🔄 Calculate Payroll" again after adding bonuses.

---

### Issue: Can't approve payroll (button missing)

**Possible Causes**:
1. Status is "draft" (not calculated yet)
2. Already approved (shows "💳 Mark Paid" instead)
3. Already paid (no buttons)

**Solution**: Check the status badge color to see current state.

---

### Issue: Export CSV is empty

**Cause**: No earnings data for selected filters.

**Solution**:
1. Change year filter
2. Select "All Staff" instead of individual
3. Verify payroll has been calculated and approved for some months

---

### Issue: Numbers don't add up

**Example**: Base pay + commission + bonuses ≠ net pay

**Possible Causes**:
1. Deductions (rare, usually $0)
2. Rounding differences
3. Calculation bug

**Solution**:
1. Check if deductions > 0
2. Recalculate payroll (may fix rounding)
3. If still wrong, contact support with details

---

### Issue: System is slow

**Possible Causes**:
1. Calculating very large payroll (50+ staff)
2. Many appointments in the period
3. Internet connection issues

**Solution**:
